# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is my personal project I designed this to analyze my birthday interactions with friends and to keep track of who I wished, who reciprocated, and in what manner. The goal is to understand patterns in these social interactions and keep track of important relationships over time.

# **🎈TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- **Libraries and Tools:** Excel, Python, PowerBI
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and creating customized tracking systems in Excel.

# 🎁METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Data Preparation

- Created a structured Excel sheet with the following columns:
    - **Name:** Friend's name.
    - **Duration of Friendship (Years):** How long I’ve known each friend.
    - **Their Birthday:** Indicated if their birthday fell before or after mine.
    - **Did I Wish Them?** Marked with **‘Y’** for yes and **‘N’** for no.
    - **My Mode of Delivery:** Whether I used a text, call, or post.
    - **Did They Wish Me?** Tracked whether they wished me back.
    - **On That Day or Belated:** Noted if their wish was on time or belated.
    - **Their Mode of Delivery:** Recorded their method of wishing.
    - **Gift Given (Y/N):** Whether I received a gift from them in the past year.

### Step 2: Data Entry and Tracking

- Recorded birthday interactions with each friend, updating entries as the year progressed.
- Used conditional formatting in Excel to visually highlight specific patterns, such as missed wishes or belated greetings.

### Step 3: Analysis and Insights

- **Friendship Trends:** Observed whether close friends or long-term friendships are more likely to exchange birthday wishes and gifts.
- **Reciprocity Patterns:** Analyzed if there was a trend in mutual wishing based on the mode of communication (e.g., friends who call are more likely to expect a call in return).
- **Delivery Method Insights:** Noted if certain types of friends preferred one mode over another (e.g., texting for casual friends vs. calling for close friends).

# 🎊KEY INSIGHTS
### **Reciprocity in Wishes**

Approximately 75% of my friends reciprocated birthday wishes, this means that people are more likely to remember your birthday if you remember theirs.

### **Wish Timeliness**

Most of my friends sent timely wishes and I interpret that as actually keeping me in mind.

### **Friendship Duration Correlation**

Friendship longevity showed a decreasing trend in wish frequency which means newer friendships were more consistent in wishing me a happy birthday.

In summary, everyone is either too busy these days or I need better friends haha 😃
